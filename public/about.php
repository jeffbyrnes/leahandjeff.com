                <h3>How We Met</h3>

                <p>Jeff and Leah met on a chilly night in February 2012. They didn’t know much about each other, having only seen a few pictures on the dating website, <a href="http://www.howaboutwe.com/">How About We <i class="fa fa-external-link"></i></a>. But Leah thought Jeff had kind eyes and Jeff thought Leah had a great smile. They met at Brick and Mortar, a cocktail joint in Leah’s neighborhood. Jeff arrived early, grabbed two seats at the bar and ordered a whiskey cocktail, a sazerac, to calm his nerves.</p>

                <p>Leah arrived a few minutes later and saddled up next to him.</p>

                <p>“What are you drinking?” she asked. When Jeff replied, Leah couldn’t help but smile — sazeracs were her favorite cocktail.</p>

                <p>Exactly two years later, Jeff and Leah went to their favorite bar, <a href="http://www.citizenpub.com/">Citizen Public House <i class="fa fa-external-link"></i></a>, to celebrate their two-year anniversary. Jeff ordered two sazeracs and proposed. Of course, Leah said yes.</p>

                <p>Jeff and Leah live in Cambridge, MA, where they continuously expand their home bar, and still enjoy the occasional sazerac.</p>

                <h3>How To Make A Sazerac</h3>

                <blockquote>
                    <p>“Take a rocks glass, add a dash of absinthe, swirl to coat the glass, then discard. In a separate mixing glass, muddle 1 tablespoon sugar with a splash of soda water. Once dissolved, add two ounces of rye whiskey (preferably 100 proof), two dashes of Peychaud’s bitters, and ice. Stir well until cold. Strain rye & bitters mixture into rocks glass and garnish with a lemon peel.”
